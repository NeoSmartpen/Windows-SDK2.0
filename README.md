## About Ncode™: service development guide 

‘Natural Handwriting’ technology based on Ncode™(Microscopic data patterns containing various types of data) is a handwriting stroke recovery technology that digitizes paper coordinates obtained by optical pen devices such as Neo smartpen. The coordinates then can be used to store handwriting stroke information, analyzed to extract meaning based on user preferences and serve as the basis for many other types of services.

## Getting started (Basic) 

#### Create a BluetoothAdapter instance

```cs
BluetoothAdapter mBtAdt = new BluetoothAdapter();
```

#### How to discover peer device

You can discover near device in a state of discorable

```cs
PenDevice[] devices = mBtAdt.FindAllDevices();
```

#### Connecting to peer device

```cs
// Device's identifier
string mac = "9C7BD2FFF014";

// You can obtain deviceClass value by delegate callback when your bluetooth connection is established.
// BluetoothAdapter create a socket. you should implements code to bind the socket with proper PenComm.
bool result = mBtAdt.Connect( mac, delegate( uint deviceClass )
{
...
} );
```

#### Create a PenComm instance

Create a PenComm instance Handling data and communication with peer device.
You should create suitable PenComm for device's protocol version.

```cs
// PenComm for Protocol Version 1.xx ( You should implements PenCommV1Callbacks interface to your parent class )
PenCommV1 mPenCommV1 = new PenCommV1( PenCommV1Callbacks );

// PenComm for Protocol Version 2.xx ( You should implements PenCommV2Callbacks interface to your parent class )
PenCommV1 mPenCommV2 = new PenCommV2( PenCommV2Callbacks );
```

#### Bluetooth Socket bind to specific PenComm class

```cs
// Device's identifier
string mac = "9C7BD2FFF014";

// You can obtain deviceClass value by delegate callback when your bluetooth connection is established.
// BluetoothAdapter create a socket. you should implements code to bind the socket with proper PenComm.
bool result = mBtAdt.Connect( mac, delegate( uint deviceClass )
{
    // if protocol version is 1.xx
    if ( deviceClass == mPenCommV1.DeviceClass )
    {
        mBtAdt.Bind( mPenCommV1 );

        // You can set the name of PenComm object in the following ways
        // If you don't set the name of the PenComm, it is automatically set to the address of a connected pen.
        mBtAdt.Bind( mPenCommV1, "name of PenComm" );

        // You can get or set a name of PenComm
        mBtAdt.Name = "name of PenComm";
    }
    // if protocol version is 2.xx
    else if ( deviceClass == mPenCommV2.DeviceClass )
    {
        mBtAdt.Bind( mPenCommV2 );
    }
} );
```

#### After Connection is established.
**PenCommV1**

```cs
// It is occured when connection is established ( You cannot use function on your device without authentication )
// sender : sender refers to the object that invoked the callback method
// maxForce : maximum level of force sensor
// swVersion : version of firmware
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onConnected( IPenComm sender, int maxForce, string swVersion )
{
	// You can obtain the PenComm object that invoked the callback method in the below ways
    // If your application need to be allow multiple connection, sender parameter will be helpful
    PenCommV1 pencomm = sender as PenCommV1;
}

// If your device is locked, it is called to input password.
// retryCount : Number of password verification attempts
// resetCount : When retryCount reaches a resetCount deletes all data stored in the pen and is the default.
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onPenPasswordRequest( IPenComm sender, int retryCount, int resetCount )
{
	// Input password to peer device
	mPenCommV1.ReqInputPassword( "string type password" );
}

// If your pen is not locked, or authentication is passed, it will be called.
// When it is called, You can use all function on your device.
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onPenAuthenticated( IPenComm sender )
{
}
```

**PenCommV2**

```cs
// It is occured when connection is established ( You cannot use function on your device without authentication )
// macAddress : identifier of device
// deviceName : name of device
// fwVersion : version of firmware
// protocolVersion : version of protocol
// subName : subname
// maxForce : maximum level of force sensor
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onConnected( IPenComm sender, string macAddress, string deviceName, string fwVersion, string protocolVersion, string subName, int maxForce )
{
}

// If your device is locked, it is called to input password.
// retryCount : Number of password verification attempts
// resetCount : When retryCount reaches a resetCount deletes all data stored in the pen and is the default.
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onPenPasswordRequest( IPenComm sender, int retryCount, int resetCount )
{
	// Input password to peer device
	mPenCommV2.ReqInputPassword( "string type password" );
}

// If your pen is not locked, or authentication is passed, it will be called.
// When it is called, You can use all function on your device.
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onPenAuthenticated( IPenComm sender )
{
}
```

#### Handling a handwriting data from peer device

```cs
// Identifier of note(paper) (it is consist of section and owner, note)
int section = 1;
int owner = 1;
int note = 102;

// Requests to set your note type.

// PenCommV1
mPenCommV1.ReqAddUsingNote(section, owner, note);

// PenCommV2
mPenCommV2.ReqAddUsingNote(section, owner, note);

// Callback method to receive writing data
// PenCommV1
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onReceiveDot( IPenComm sender, Dot dot )
{
// TODO : You should implements code using coordinate data.
}

// PenCommV2
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onReceiveDot( IPenComm sender, Dot dot, ImageProcessingInfo info )
{
// TODO : You should implements code using coordinate data.
}
```

#### Querying list of offline data in Smartpen's storage

```cs
// Requests to get offline data list
// PenCommV1
mPenCommV1.ReqOfflineDataList();

// PenCommV2
mPenCommV2.ReqOfflineDataList();

// Callback method to receive offline data list
// PenCommV1
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onOfflineDataList( IPenComm sender, OfflineDataInfo[] notes )
{
}

// PenCommV2
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onReceiveOfflineDataList( IPenComm sender, params OfflineDataInfo[] offlineNotes )
{
}

```

#### Downloading offline data in Smartpen's storage
**PenCommV1**
```cs
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onOfflineDataList( IPenComm sender, OfflineDataInfo[] notes )
{
}

// Requests to download offline data
mPenCommV1.ReqOfflineData( OfflineDataInfo data );

// it is invoked when begins downloading offline data
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onStartOfflineDownload( IPenComm sender )
{
}

// it is invoked when it changed progress ( it can be called several times )
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onUpdateOfflineDownload( IPenComm sender, int total, int progress )
{
}

// it is invoked when it obtained offline data ( it can be called several times )
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onReceiveOfflineStrokes( IPenComm sender, Stroke[] strokes )
{
}

// it is invoked when finished downloading
void PenCommV1Callbacks.onFinishedOfflineDownload( IPenComm sender, bool success )
{
}
```

**PenCommV2**
```cs
// Requests to download offline data
mPenCommV2.ReqOfflineData( data.Section, data.Owner, data.Note, false, data.Pages );

// it is invoked when begins downloading offline data
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onStartOfflineDownload( IPenComm sender )
{
}

// it is invoked when it obtained offline data ( it can be called several times )
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onReceiveOfflineStrokes( IPenComm sender, int total, int progress, Stroke[] strokes )
{
}

// it is invoked when finished downloading
void PenCommV2Callbacks.onFinishedOfflineDownload( IPenComm sender, bool success )
{
}
```

#### Metadata Processing
We use Ncode™ paper information as a metadata file called nproj.
This section describes how to load and use the nproj file.
nproj has an object named Symbol, so when the handwriting is written in the area of the symbol, the SDK can detect it and receive the symbol information with the callback.

See the link below for a detailed description of nproj.

[Caster™ Lite XML format spec (english).pdf](https://github.com/NeoSmartpen/Documentations/blob/master/Caster%E2%84%A2%20Lite%20XML%20format%20spec%20(english).pdf)

```cs
// Create MetadataManager
mMetadataManager = new GenericMetadataManager(new NProjParser());

// Bind MetadataManager to PenComm.
mPenCommV2.MetadataManager = mMetadataManager;

try
{
	// Load the Metadata file.
	mMetadataManager.Load(Application.StartupPath + "\\Resources\\note_603.nproj");
}
catch (ParseException)
{
	// todo : Handling of parsing errors
}
catch (FileNotFoundException)
{
}
catch
{
}

void PenCommV2Callbacks.onSymbolDetected(IPenComm sender, List<Symbol> symbols)
{
	// todo : Processing for detected symbols
	// Implement functions corresponding to predefined Actions.
	// For example, if Symbol's Action is email, it sends an email.
}
```
